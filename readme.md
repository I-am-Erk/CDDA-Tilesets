Community-made tilesets for [Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA).
Tilesets give the game a different aesthetic.

This repository stores individual sprites in PNG format, and also source files with layering in `.psd` (Photoshop), `.xcf` (GIMP 2.10), `.kra` (Krita) and `.ase`/`.aseprite` (Aseprite) formats.
PNGs will then be compiled into a tileset using [a python script](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/master/tools/gfx_tools/compose.py).

For information about installing and contributing see [**documentation**](https://i-am-erk.github.io/CDDA-Tilesets).

## Tilesets

All of the tileset in this repository are included in a release of the game.
You can just load into the game and see what they are like for yourself.

of these community-driven tilesets!
Development is constantly ongoing!

### [UltiCa](gfx/UltimateCataclysm)

**UltiCa** (*Ulti*mate *Ca*taclysm) was inspired by old school pixel art games
and tries to encapsulate a dark tone and atmosphere of utter desperation of the
cataclysm.

It is the default tileset used when you use the tiles version of the game.

### [AltiCa](gfx/Altica)

An alternative UltiCa. Using a Chibified version of the Character sprite, everything else is the same.

### [MSXotto+/MShockXotto+](gfx/MShockXotto+)

MShockXotto+ often abreviated MSX is a descendant of two older tilesets MShock and Xotto tilesets, named after their respective author. This version aims for a colorfull cartoony/anime style that is clean and easy to read.

### [Chibi Ultica](gfx/Chibi_Ultica)

Chibi Ultica is a combination of MSXotto+ tileset for monsters and characters,
the Chibi part, and the Ultica tileset for the rest of the world.

### [RetroDays](gfx/Retrodays)

RetroDays present a very simple and retro aesthetic reminiscent of  old console ASCII graphics, with a very limited color palette and small 10x10 sprites

### [NeoDays](gfx/NeoDays)

Neodays is a modified version of RetroDays. That uses more "modern" effects like overlay, transparency and animations

### [GiantDays](gfx/GiantDays)

GiantDays is heavily based on Neodays, itself a modified version of RetroDays.

### [BrownLikeBears](gfx/BrownLikeBears)

BrownLikeBears is a neat tileset based on RetroDays. BrownLikeBears uses a pastel color palette, has biger sprites, and uses brown instead of black.

### [HollowMoon](gfx/HollowMoon)

HollowMoon is a retro style tileset aiming to emulate the style of the early Gameboy era

### [Mushroom Dream](gfx/Mushroom-Dream)

Mushroom Dream is a high quality tileset entierly made by @AlbertTheTerrible . We host here a small stub of the tileset that was initially released under cc by sa, a more complete version released under a more restrictive license is available on Albert's parteon.
