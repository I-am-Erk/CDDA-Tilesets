# Style guidelines

We have rules for sprites these days.
Not only because it's important to keep tilesets consistent, but also to make things recognizable on the screen in the game.
Without strict rules, any tileset will quickly turn itself into a mash up of pixels.

Different tilesets have different guides:

- [UltimateCataclysm (Ultica)](./UltimateCataclysm/summary.md)
- [MShockXotto+](./MShockXotto+/summary.md)
- [HollowMoon](./HollowMoon/summary.md)
