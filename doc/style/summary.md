# Style guidelines

We have rules for sprites these days.
Not because it's important to keep the tileset consistent, but also to make things recognizable on the screen in the game.
Without strict rules, any tileset will quickly turn itself into a pixels mash up.

Different tilesets have different guides:
 - [UltimateCataclysm (Ultica)](./UltimateCataclysm/summary.md)
 - [MShockXotto+](./MShockXotto+/summary.md)
 - [HollowMoon](./HollowMoon/summary.md)
