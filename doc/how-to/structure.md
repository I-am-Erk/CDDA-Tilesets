# Tileset structure

//TODO: rewrite document from scratch

- Put files into the best appropriate folder (terrain, furniture, mutations, items, etc).
- Give files a name based on the JSON ID they suit, eg `t_floor`.
- If multiple files apply to that ID, make a subfolder eg `terrain/t_floor/` for all the views.
- For the moment, there isn't a clear naming convention after that. Working on it.
