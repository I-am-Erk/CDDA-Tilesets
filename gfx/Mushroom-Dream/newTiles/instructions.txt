Hey mate. Here's some instructions when making the tiles to make it easier.

Dirt Tile - Has 2 variants. Make the one with the big rocks (uppper one) less common. I'd say 30% (out of 100)

Pavement tiles - Includes yellow pavement too. Make the non damaged pavement more common. I'd say 74% for the regular one and 5% each
for the damaged ones. The pavement with a little water i'd make it rarer, at about 1-2%  

Brickwall and side window/side wall- are all 32x48 tiles, the pink part should not be visible because 
it should be hidding in the wall bellow it, i think. I placed it there to make it easier to tile up

Tall grass - i fixed it for you

Btw, have you sped up the fire? It should be like twice as fast since last i saw. I remember you saying it was 9 frames per img
I felt like it should be 5-6. If you explain to me how to do it, i could give it a try to see how fast it should be.

Thanks man!
