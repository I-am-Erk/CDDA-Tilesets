Dedication.

To the memory of my beloved parents, whose absence is felt every day.
Your love, guidance, and unwavering support have shaped who I am today.
I miss you more than words can express.

To the memory of all the Ukrainians who have lost their lives in the war with Russia.
Your courage and sacrifice will never be forgotten.
May your spirits find peace, and may your legacy inspire future generations.
