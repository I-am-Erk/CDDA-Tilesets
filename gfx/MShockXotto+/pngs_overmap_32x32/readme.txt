hi (:

If you can't tell what some of these are, let me know and ill try to make them better (or name them better, whichever is the issue). Don't be afraid to criticise them, I can use suggestions and stuff! Sorry for bugging you to do json work for me, but thanks for helping!

P.S: I'm still considering changes I can make to some of these so please don't merge to the actual tileset yet, I'll probably end up changing them, unless you're ok with me changing them after they're added. (Houses are iffy)

p.P.s: I should be able to figure some of this out after I see an example of how the stuff is actually meant to be coded into the game (jsons).

p.P.P.S:
